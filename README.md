## Overview
The `utils` package offers a collection of utility functions designed to facilitate advanced type manipulation, pointer generation, and development conveniences in Go. These functions leverage unsafe operations to provide flexibility beyond the Go type system's safety constraints. Users should apply these utilities with understanding of their underlying behavior and potential side effects.
