# Utils Package Documentation

The infamous utils package.
Here there be dragons.
Use with extreme caution.
This package has many functions that allow you to completely sidestep the go type system.
They attempt to do so in a way that is as safe as possible.
If used correctly, they are very powerful.
If you are considering using these tools then you have probably missed the correct way to do  what you want.
If you have to use this, please consider pairing it with the SafeOps package utilities to wrap your code in a safe way.
